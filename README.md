# Real Estate Application

Welcome to my Real Estate Application, a .NET Core MVC Web Application that combines essential features and customizations for a powerful real estate management platform.

## Features

- **Authentication**: I've implemented secure access using Individual User Accounts.

- **Database Integration**: My application integrates seamlessly with a SQL Server database for robust data management.

- **Data Models**: I've structured two model classes with a one-to-many relationship, ensuring well-organized database tables.

- **CRUD Functionality**: You'll find Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) operations easily accessible through MVC Scaffolding.

- **User Interface**: My user interface is user-friendly and enhanced with navigation links, a clear title, an informative footer, and engaging home page content.

- **Theme Customization**: To give my application a unique and appealing look, I've customized the theme by incorporating the "eBusiness" Bootstrap template. This template, provided by [BootstrapMade.com](https://bootstrapmade.com/), was updated with Bootstrap v5.3.2.

- **Advanced Feature: View Components**: I've introduced an advanced feature called 'View Components,' which enables us to create and reuse complex content elements. This includes elements like dynamic menus, sign-in panels, and other intricate content.
